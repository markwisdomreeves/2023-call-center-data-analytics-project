Call Center Data - Data Analytics

Objective: In this exercise, I performed Data Analytics on an Open Dataset dataset coming from Airbnb. Some of the tasks include Data Extracting. 
Data Cleaning. Data Reorganizing. Data Transformation. Data Visualization.

From the dataset, we found that Electronics EMS-related calls represented the most 911 calls, followed by traffic and then fire. 
We also found two outliers that occurred on March 2nd, 2018, and November 15th, 2018, both likely due to severe weather conditions, and mentioned how, 
with more research, you could draw insights from the investigation of these two dates and the data behind them.
